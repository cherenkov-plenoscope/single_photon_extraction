%
The atmospheric Cherenkov-method can reconstruct the type, energy, and direction of a cosmic particle from an air-shower's Cherenkov-light.
%
Cherenkov-telescopes sense blueish Cherenkov-light, better reject reddish night-sky-light, and reconstruct the arrival-times of photons with $\sim{}$5\,ns resolution.
%
Photo-sensors and read-out are cost-drivers of the method.
\newline
%
We expect a continues read-out into digital buffers, where each individual photon is recorded, to be beneficial for the atmospheric Cherenkov-method as it allows fast computational access to all observables.
%
The energy-threshold can be lower \cite{jung2005star}, the separation of Cherenkov- from night-sky-light can be better, and overall the reconstruction of the cosmic particle will benefit\cite{catalano2008single}.
\newline
%
One way of continues read-out are flash analog-digital-converters (ADC)s.
%
However, their cost and power-consumption scale rapidly with their sampling frequency $\fadc{}$.
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{Cost} &\sim& \fadc{}^2,\\
\text{Power} &\sim& \fadc{}^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
%
In this report, we explore a read-out with many slow \mbox{($f$ < 100\,MHz)} ADCs.
%
We want each ADC to digitize the signal of a photo-sensor that has little acceptances (area $\times{}$ solid angle) and thus a low rate of night-sky-photons.
%
We hope that when the rate of night-sky-photons is low, a slow ADC and a little computing will be able to reconstruct the arrival-times of the individual photons sufficiently accurate with $\pm5\,$ns, i.e. better than the sampling-period $1/\fadc{}$.
%
Since the cost of silicon photo-sensors are mostly proportional to their area, there is only little overhead when replacing a big sensor with multiple small ones.
%
Due to the rapid scaling of the ADC's demands with sampling-frequency $\fadc{}$, many slow ADCs might outperform fewer fast ADCs in both power-consumption and cost.
\newline
Further, the finer binning of photo-sensors might allow plenoscopes with large  field-of-views ($> 300\,(1^\circ{})^2$) due to computational compensation of optical aberrations. \cite{mueller2019phd}.

\section*{Simulating a slow ADC-read-out}%
\label{SecSimulating}%
%
To estimate the reconstruction power of a read-out with slow sampling ADC's, we run a simulation.
%
We simulate the electric response of a silicon photo-sensor (G-APD-array).
%
Our readout is designed around an ADC with a sampling-rate $\fadc{}=83.3$\,MHz and a resolution of 8\,bit.
%
Table \ref{TabReadOutConfig} shows the configuration of our read-out.
%
\begin{table}[H]

}
        \label{TabReadOutConfig}
    \end{center}
\end{table}
%
\subsection*{Analog path}%
%
The analog path of our read-out is designed to match $\fadc{}$ with a gain that drops down to 1/2 (-3dB) at the ADC's Nyquist-frequency $f = \fadc{}/2$, see Figure \ref{FigSimAnalogTransmission}.
%
The electric coupling to the photo-sensor is chosen for the pulse to have a decay-time that covers multiple ADC samples.
%
To avoid additional noise and artifacts, we do not use pulse-shaping such as $\lambda /2$ reflections.
%
Figure \ref{FigSimPulseTemplate} shows our electric pulse in the analog path and Figure \ref{FigSimPulsePhases} shows the pulse for various relative phases w.r.t. the ADC's sampling.
%
\subsection*{ADC}%
%
Our ADC has a white noise-amplitude of $0.1\Apulse{}$ \footnote{The same noise-amplitude as FACT.}, where $\Apulse{}$ is the maximum amplitude of the pulse at the ADC's input, i.e. after the low-pass.
%
Our ADC's amplitude-range spans from $-0.8\Apulse{}$ to $12.0\Apulse{}$. This means it will saturate for a coincident stack larger than 12 photons and gives us about 20 amplitude-steps for $\Apulse{}$.
%
\subsection*{Processing path}%
%
Our digital processing over samples the ADC's signal with a sampling-frequency of $\fproc{} = 6\fadc{} = 500.0$\,MHz, and with a four times higher amplitude-resolution of 10\,bit.
%
The digital processing does not interpolate or smooth the ADC's signal, but for example in internal convolutions with a kernel-function the processing makes use of its higher resolution.
%
We design all algorithms for the digital processing without conditional branching, i.e. easy to implement with basic logic gates.
%
We have Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)s in mind, but happily use CPUs when fast enough.
%
\subsection*{Extracting photon-arrivals}%
%
We test two algorithms to extract the arrival-times of photons from the digital signal.
%
These algorithms run in the digital processing path of our read-out and thus operate with sampling-frequency $\fproc{}$ and 10\,bit amplitude-resolution.
%
They are FPGA-aware.
%
\subsubsection*{Convolution-Maximum}%
%
Our first algorithm convolves the signal with a template of the pulse's rising edge, see Figure \ref{FigSimRisingEdgeTemplate}.
%
When the response of the convolution is above a threshold of $0.4\Apulse{}$, AND when the gradient of the response is rising, AND when all these conditions where not in the previous time-sample, than the current time-sample is identified to be the arrival of a pulse.
%
\subsubsection*{Multi-Subtraction}%
%
The second algorithm also convolves the signal with the template of the pulse's rising edge. It also uses the response of the convolution to estimate the arrival-time of a pulse.
%
But it does not take the current pulse into account when the decay of an earlier pulse effects the current pulse.
%
When a leading, unaffected pulse is found, its arrival-time is exported, and the pulse is subtracted from the signal using a predefined template.
%
This means that a single stage of this algorithm will not extract all arrival-times when the pulses are too dense.
%
To improve this, multiple stages of the same algorithm are used in series.
%
The input signal for the next stage is the output signal of the current stage.
%
Each stage subtracts the leading pulses.
%
Here, we use 12 stages.
%
\subsection*{Simulating night-sky-light}%
%
We create analog signals where we add pulses according to a specific rate of night-sky-photons $R_\text{nsb}$.
%
The distribution of delays $\Delta t$ between the arrival-times of night-sky-photon is
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta t &=& - \mathrm{log}\left( \frac{\text{prng.uniform(0, 1)}}{R_\text{nsb}}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
%
where prng.uniform(0, 1) is a uniform pseudo random number generator.
%
Thus we know the true arrival-time of each photon.
%
\subsection*{Benchmarking}%
%
Each of our extraction-algorithms returns a list of reconstructed arrival-times of photons.
%
We compare this reconstructed list with the list of true arrival-times.
%
Using coincidence-intervals we search for true-positive, false-negative, and false-positive matches \footnote{We struggle to define true-negative matches.}.
%
On long signals with many night-sky-photons, we count the occurrence of such matching cases and estimate the true-positive-rate and the false-negative-rate in dependency of the coincidence-interval.

\section*{Result}
%
Figure \ref{FigSimPerformanceVsNsb} shows the true-positive-rate, and the false-negative-rate of our slow ADC-read-out for various rates $R_\text{nsb}$ of night-sky-photons and various coincidence-intervals.
%
We vary $R_\text{nsb}$ from $2\times10^6$s$^{-1}$ to $32\times10^6$s$^{-1}$.
%
Both the simple convolution-maximum-algorithm and the more complex multi-subtraction-algorithm perform equally good for low rates of $R_\text{nsb} \approx 2\times{}10^{6}$s$^{-1}$.
%
Only when the rate rises, the convolution-maximum-algorithm looses performance while the multi-subtraction-algorithm drops only little in performance up to $R_\text{nsb} \approx 16\times{}10^{6}$s$^{-1}$.

\section*{Conclusion}
%
Assuming we demand observations up to fluxes of night-sky-photons of $\F{}/\Ftyp{} = 4$, then we can operate our slow ADC-read-out with the multi-subtraction-algorithm and silicon photo-sensors that have an acceptance (behind mirrors) as high as
\begin{eqnarray}
Q_\text{SiPM-mirror} = 0.021\,\text{m}^{2}\,(1^\circ{})^2.
\end{eqnarray}
%
This yields $R_\text{nsb} = 4\times{}10^6$s$^{-1}$ for $\F{}/\Ftyp{} = 1$, and $R_\text{nsb} = 16\times{}10^6$s$^{-1}$ for $\F{}/\Ftyp{} = 4$.
%
With a typical pixel's field-of-view of $\approx{} 0.01\,(1^\circ{})^2$, this leaves us $2\,$m$^{2}$ for the aperture-area.
%
Today, the photo-sensors of Cherenkov-telescopes have rates starting at 8\,times larger going up to 80\,times larger, see Table \ref{TabInstrumentsNsbRates}.
%
However, when one can obtain the benefits of plenoptic perception with aberration-compensation for free, then an increase in read-out-channels by a factor of 8 does not sound so unreasonable.
